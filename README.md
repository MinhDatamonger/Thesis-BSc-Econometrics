This is a repository of my thesis project for the BSc Econometrics and Data Science, with the title "THE SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING DILEMMA IN
FORECASTING INFLATION". In this thesis project, I performed forecasting of US inflation with eleven different prediction models, ranging from simple time series methods to advanced deep learning algorithms. 
The primary goal was to assess whether supervised or unsupervised learning is more effective for predicting inflation. The supervised learning models I tested include: 
Support Vector Regression (SVR),
Feedd-Forward Neural Network (FFN),
Linear Regression,
Ridge,
LASSO.

My unsupervised learning portfolio consists of:
k-means clustering, 
Gaussian Hidden Markov Model, 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Along with that I benchmarked these ML models with classical time series models: ARMA, VAR, and Historical Average.

The full code of all the models can be found in the file "Thesis_Code_full.ipynb". The separate code for Generative Adversarial Network model is copied separately to the file "GAN_forecast.ipynb".
The data for the project is loaded directly from drive in the code. The reasoning and explanation of the models can be found in the "Econometrics_Thesis_Nguyen_Duc_Minh.pdf" file.
